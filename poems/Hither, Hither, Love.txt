HITHER hither, love---
'Tis a shady mead---
Hither, hither, love!
Let us feed and feed!
Hither, hither, sweet---
'Tis a cowslip bed---
Hither, hither, sweet!
'Tis with dew bespread!
Hither, hither, dear
By the breath of life,
Hither, hither, dear!---
Be the summer's wife!
Though one moment's pleasure
In one moment flies---
Though the passion's treasure
In one moment dies;---
Yet it has not passed---
Think how near, how near!---
And while it doth last,
Think how dear, how dear!
Hither, hither, hither
Love its boon has sent---
If I die and wither
I shall die content!
